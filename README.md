# 🏥 **Hospital Administration System (MySQL)**


## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-world Hospital Administration System** using **MySQL**.  
It manages hospital operations such as **departments, doctors, patients, appointments, and billing**.

The project is designed as a **Junior SQL Developer portfolio project** and demonstrates:
- Relational database design
- Table relationships using foreign keys
- Business-oriented SQL queries
- CRUD operations
- Advanced SQL concepts

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **MySQL / MySQL Workbench** – Database creation, table design, queries, and data manipulation  
- **SQL** – Joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Source dataset for hospital records  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  
- **VS Code / SQL Editor** – Writing and organizing SQL scripts
